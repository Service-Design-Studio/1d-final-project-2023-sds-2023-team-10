Feature: Admin Dashboard - sentiment analysis
    As a medical practitioner/professional/counsellor
    I want to be able to view users' sentiment through the admin platform to make assessments


    #1
    Scenario: Looking through sentiment analysis
        Given the admin is in a chat
        Then the admin should see a profile of the user containing a sentiment analysis graph


    #2 - Sad path
    Scenario: Empty sentiment analysis
        Given the admin is in an active chat
        When the user has not given any positive or negative responses
        Then the admin will see the sentiment analysis graph at a constant of 0.5
