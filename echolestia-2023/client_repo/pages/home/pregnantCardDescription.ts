  firstTrimester:
    "During the first trimester of your pregnancy, your body is adjusting to the new life growing inside of you. You may experience common symptoms such as fatigue, morning sickness (which can occur any time of day), tender breasts, and increased urination. It's also likely that you'll have some emotional changes due to hormonal fluctuations. As your baby develops, don't be surprised if you feel anxious or overwhelmed at times – this is normal. To navigate this trimester smoothly, eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and try to get plenty of rest. It's essential to communicate with your healthcare provider and discuss any concerns or questions you may have. Remember that seeking support from loved ones can also be helpful during this time.",
  secondTrimester: `Congratulations, you've entered the second trimester of your pregnancy! This period is often referred to as the "honeymoon phase," as many of the first-trimester symptoms ease or subside. You may notice an increase in energy levels and a decrease in morning sickness. As your baby grows, you'll start to develop a noticeable baby bump, and you may begin feeling fetal movements. Be prepared for some new symptoms, including leg cramps, mild swelling in your feet and ankles, and possibly lower back pain. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, staying active, and keeping up with your prenatal appointments. At this stage, you'll also have an anatomy scan (ultrasound) to assess the baby's growth and development. Enjoy this phase and continue to take care of yourself and your baby.`,
  thirdTrimester: `Welcome to the final stretch of your pregnancy journey – the third trimester! As your baby continues to grow, you may start to feel more uncomfortable as your body accommodates the extra weight. Symptoms you might experience include shortness of breath, heartburn, pelvic pain, and difficulty sleeping. Your baby's movements may become more pronounced as they grow and run out of space to move around. During this trimester, you'll have more frequent visits to your healthcare provider to monitor your baby's health and development. It's important to continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle, manage stress, and make time for relaxation and self-care. As your due date approaches, make sure to finalize your preparations for the baby's arrival and discuss your birth plan with your partner and healthcare team.`,
