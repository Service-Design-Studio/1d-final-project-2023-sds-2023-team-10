## Valuing Women's Choices, No Matter the Road

### Problem Description

Singapore grapples with a multifaceted issue combining high abortion rates, unsafe practices, and a diminishing birth rate. In 2020 alone, Singapore witnessed 4,029 abortions, an average of 336 every month. This concern is aggravated by the country's ageing populace and the perils of unsafe abortion techniques that jeopardize both maternal and fetal well-being. Consolidating data from distinct help centers and government agencies is crucial for offering holistic support to those confronting unexpected pregnancies. Addressing these intertwined dilemmas is indispensable for the future well-being of Singapore.

### Our Problem Statements

#### Pregnant Women

For a woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, the path to finding reliable information, emotional aid, and pragmatic resources is fraught with sifting through countless sources, navigating societal stigma, and confronting a baffling assortment of choices.

**Question**: How can we simplify the process for women to obtain tailored assistance, interact with professional counselors, and secure the essential emotional support without overwhelming or complicating their journey?

#### Social Service Agencies

For an administrator engaged with social service agencies or medical practitioners assisting women with unexpected pregnancies, it's challenging and time-consuming to juggle various communication channels and manually process inquiries to offer precise support and counsel.

**Question**: How can we enhance the management of these inquiries, prioritize cases more efficiently without sacrificing service quality, or overwhelming administrators with intricate features?

### Our Design Journey

#### User Personas

Our team began by crafting several user personas, which were instrumental in grasping the challenges our target audience faces. Given that our team comprises six men, this phase was pivotal in fostering empathy and relevance towards our target audience's needs.

#### Storyboards

To empathize with our target users, we illustrated numerous storyboards. Considering our two-fold user base, we designed storyboards encapsulating the viewpoints of both user groups.

#### Prototypes

Informed by a comprehensive understanding of the problem, we embarked on designing two distinct web applications - the User app and the Admin app. Our design phase commenced with a basic low-fidelity prototype, which later evolved into a detailed high-fidelity prototype.

#### User Stories

Anchored in Agile methodologies, our team formulated multiple user stories to encapsulate the core requirements and aspirations of our users. We integrated the Cucumber software complemented by the Puppeteer library for testing our applications.

### Our Solution

Post four Agile sprints, Team Echolestia is proud to unveil two web applications facilitating seamless communication between our dual user groups, which we term the User and Admin applications.

**User App**: This application empowers pregnant women and their families and friends with up-to-date information regarding their pregnancy. Additionally, the app provides remote consultations from medical professionals and counselors.

**Admin App**: Tailored for staff from social service agencies and doctors, this application offers a platform to liaise with and assist their clientele or patients. The app encompasses chat and article features, enabling professionals to keep a pulse on their clients' emotional and physical well-being.
